La Mezcalera: https://www.facebook.com/lamezcaleratj?fref=ts
(Try different mezcales)

La Mija: https://www.facebook.com/LaMijadeMezcalera?fref=ts 
(Back room/patio of La Mezcalera. Has a funky floor and good dancing music)

Tropics: https://www.facebook.com/tropics.bar.5?pnref=story
(Dive bar right next to La Mezcalera. Stays open until very late, and it's the place everyone goes when being kicked out of other bars. But just to be sure, get in there before 2am)

La Estrella: https://www.facebook.com/LaEstrellaTijuana?fref=ts
(You'll see old ladies and dudes dancing ranchero, salsa or cumbia music. It's an awesome place to do people watching and you might get asked to dance by an older lady)

Porky's Place: https://www.facebook.com/porkysplacelasexta?fref=ts 
(They play 80's music; good to dance)

Hong Kong: http://hktijuana.com.mx/
(If you're going to hit some Tijuana strip clubs, you better visit this one. They charge a small cover but you get a beer, and inside everyone speaks english. It's super fun, and closes like at 6am.)

### Restaurants and bars in Río area:

If you stay at the Hotel Lucerna, these places are 2 blocks away:

Bar 20: http://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-20-tijuana (Upscale bar, next to restaurant Misión 19)

If you have any other questions feel free to ask. I've been to a handful of these places, if you want the gringo opinion. We can probably compile a list of things to do in Rosarito/Ensenada if you want to venture even further south. 

If you're planning to catch a flight back to your homeland in the States, make sure you account for the fact that traveling into the States can take three hours by car. The worst times to cross the border are the typical commuting hours (6am - 10am, 4pm - 7pm).
